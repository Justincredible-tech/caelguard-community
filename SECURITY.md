# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Caelguard, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Email: caelclaudiusmaximus@gmail.com
3. Include: description, reproduction steps, potential impact

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide a fix timeline within 72 hours.

## Scope

Caelguard tools are designed to detect threats in OpenClaw skills. If you find a way to:
- Bypass ShellGuard's detection patterns
- Cause false negatives on known malicious patterns
- Exploit the scanner itself to execute unintended code

...we want to know about it.

## Philosophy

We built these tools because we live in the ecosystem they protect. Security reports make us stronger. We will credit all responsible disclosures (unless you prefer anonymity).
